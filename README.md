# CrossCode Map Editor

CrossCode Map Editor build with [Angular](https://angular.io/) and [Phaser](https://phaser.io/). It's still early in development so don't expect too much.

## Getting started

To use the editor you need to run the backend and the webapp

### backend
move into the `backend` folder and then install dependencies via `npm`
```
npm install
```
Open the file `src/config.ts` and change the path to your CrossCode assets folder.
After that move back to the `backend` folder and start the server with
```
npm start
```

### webapp
move into the `webapp` folder and then install dependencies via `npm`
```
npm install
```
and then run the dev server with
```
npm start
```

Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
